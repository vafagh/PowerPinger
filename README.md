A lightweight, standalone PowerShell-based network scanner designed to detect network filtering patterns through intelligent ping and port scanning. **Runs natively on Windows 10+ without any additional software installation or dependencies** - perfect for deployment in restricted networks where software installations are limited.

**Key Benefits:**
- üöÄ **Zero Dependencies**: Works with built-in Windows PowerShell (no downloads required)
- üì¶ **Ultra Portable**: ~1000 lines of code + IP list files easily transferable into restricted networks
- üõ°Ô∏è **Filtering Detection**: Advanced analysis of network access patterns and connectivity restrictions
- ‚ö° **Instant Deployment**: Ready to run on any Windows 10+ system immediately

## üöÄ Features

### üîç **Four Scanning Modes**
- **`ping`** - Traditional ICMP ping scanning (backward compatible)
- **`port`** - TCP port scanning only (bypasses ICMP blocks)
- **`both`** - Combined ping + port analysis
- **`smart`** - Intelligent network filtering detection with pattern analysis

### üõ°Ô∏è **Network Filtering Detection**
- **ICMP-Blocked**: Detects when ping fails but services are accessible
- **Ping-Only**: Identifies when ping works but services are unavailable
- **Service-Filtering**: Discovers deep packet inspection patterns
- **Full-Access**: Normal connectivity baseline
- **Unassigned-Range**: Distinguishes between filtered and unassigned IP spaces

### ‚ö° **Advanced Features**
- **Zero Dependencies**: Runs on Windows 10+ built-in PowerShell (no installations required)
- **Ultra Portable**: ~1000 lines of code + IP list = complete network analysis toolkit
- **Jump Mode**: Skip unresponsive IP blocks intelligently
- **Response Limiting**: Stop scanning after finding sufficient responsive IPs per range
- **Range Processing**: Handle CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- **Multiple Formats**: Support CSV, TXT input files
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live scanning progress with color coding
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed CSV output with timestamps
- **Cross-Platform**: PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell Core 6+ support
- **Stealth Operation**: Appears as normal network diagnostic script

## üì¶ Installation

### **üöÄ Zero-Dependency Deployment (Recommended for Restricted Networks)**

**PowerPinger requires NO additional software installation!** It runs on any Windows 10+ system using the built-in PowerShell.

**For Restricted/Corporate Networks:**
1. **Download only 2 files** (~1000 lines total):
   - `powerPinger.ps1` (main script)
   - Your IP list file (e.g., `targets.csv`)

2. **Transfer method options**:
   - USB drive
   - Email attachment
   - File sharing systems
   - Code repository access
   - Any available file transfer method

3. **Run immediately** (no installation required):
```powershell
# Allow script execution (one-time setup)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Run the scanner
.\powerPinger.ps1
```

### **üåê Full Repository Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vafagh/PowerPinger.git
cd PowerPinger
```

2. **Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows scripts:**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

3. **Verify PowerShell version (5.1+ required):**
```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

## üéØ Quick Start

### **Interactive Mode (Recommended for beginners)**
```powershell
.\powerPinger.ps1
```
- Guided setup with file selection menus
- Interactive parameter configuration
- Built-in help and examples

### **Command-Line Mode (Advanced users)**
```powershell
# Basic ping scanning
.\powerPinger.ps1 -InputFile "sample_ips.csv" -OutputFile "results.csv"

# Smart network filtering detection
.\powerPinger.ps1 -InputFile "targets.csv" -ScanMode "smart" -Ports "80,443,22"

# Port-only scanning (bypass ICMP blocks)
.\powerPinger.ps1 -InputFile "blocked_ips.csv" -ScanMode "port" -Ports "80,443,8080"
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### **1. Network Firewall Detection**
Perfect for detecting when network policies allow ping but restrict services:
```powershell
.\powerPinger.ps1 -InputFile "target_ranges.csv" -ScanMode "smart" -Ports "80,443,22,53"
```

### **2. Bypass ICMP Restrictions**
Skip ping completely and test services directly:
```powershell
.\powerPinger.ps1 -InputFile "targets.csv" -ScanMode "port" -Ports "80,443,8080,8443"
```

### **3. Comprehensive Analysis**
Full network filtering pattern detection:
```powershell
.\powerPinger.ps1 -InputFile "ranges.csv" -ScanMode "both" -Timeout 5000 -PortTimeout 3000
```

### **4. Fast Scanning with Jump Mode**
Skip dead IP blocks automatically:
```powershell
.\powerPinger.ps1 -InputFile "large_range.csv" -Jump 10 -MaxFailures 3 -Skip 5
```

### **5. Limit Responses per Range**
Stop scanning after finding enough responsive IPs to save time:
```powershell
# Stop after finding 5 responsive IPs per range
.\powerPinger.ps1 -InputFile "dense_networks.csv" -MaxResponses 5

# Quick network discovery (3 responses per range)
.\powerPinger.ps1 -InputFile "ranges.csv" -MaxResponses 3 -ScanMode "smart"
```

## üîç Network Filtering Pattern Detection

### **Pattern Types**

#### **üö´ ICMP-Blocked**
- **Symptoms**: Ping fails, but services are accessible
- **Indication**: Network/firewall blocks diagnostic tools but allows services
- **Common in**: Corporate networks, managed environments
- **Example**: Enterprise allowing HTTP but blocking ping

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Ping-Only** 
- **Symptoms**: Ping succeeds, but no services accessible
- **Indication**: Deep packet inspection or service-level filtering
- **Common in**: Advanced filtering, managed networks
- **Example**: Allowlist scenarios where only ping is permitted

#### **‚ùì Unassigned-Range**
- **Symptoms**: No ping response and no service connections
- **Indication**: IP range not allocated or host not configured
- **Common in**: Unused IP spaces, decommissioned networks
- **Technical**: Distinguished from blocking by lack of active filtering response

#### **‚úÖ Full-Access**
- **Symptoms**: Both ping and services work normally
- **Indication**: No network filtering detected
- **Common in**: Free internet regions

## üåç Real-World Applications
